# SolanaHackerfestProject

**Solana Health Informatics (SolHI)**
The project is centered around SOLHI, a revolutionary mobile application designed to prevent medical data leakage and ensure the security of patients' data. The app prioritizes user experience with an intuitive and user-friendly design, making it accessible to both tech enthusiasts and beginners. It leverages blockchain technology to decentralize data storage, ensuring security by spreading information across a network and making it harder to breach. The use of blockchain also enhances data integrity and privacy, allowing secure sharing only among authorized parties. SOLHI is compatible with a wide range of devices and platforms, providing a seamless and secure experience for users. Additionally, the app employs state-of-the-art encryption and protection measures to safeguard data, giving users peace of mind. The long-term vision is to become a trusted leader in the healthcare technology industry, setting new standards for safeguarding medical information and ensuring the safety of patients' data.


Background of the Project

**Arweave (General Understandings)**

- Blockchain based storage platform designed to provide permanent, decentralized
storage for web content and applications.

- Data and Storage Permanence: Capable of storing data (content, files or applications)
in decentralized manner permanently. *Solana can be used to build applications that
interact with storing data with Arweave.

- Cross-Chain Communication: Smart Contracts and Applications with Solana can be
created by developers using Arweave interactions.

- Decentralised Applications (dApps): dApp can be build by leveraging the benefits
from both platforms. Solana as the transaction processor and Arweave as the
immutable data and content storing agent.

Typical Bank Transfer exposes the individual to the risks of technical issues, account hacked, leak personal details, a limited daily transaction and additional charges (tax). 
With the introduction of blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, which are forms of virtual currency can be transferred via this functionality. Blockchain prevents counterfeit currency transactions (money notes), does not require centralized authorities (banker/broker) and it is highly protected by strong and complex encryption algorithms.
All the transactional details and user details (remaining sum of currencies after action) are linked in a block by taking the reference of the previous details of the block (updating the block data). This is also known as a ledger, a chain of transactional references in the blocks.

**Solana Health Informatics (SolHI)**

Hacker proof (resistant to alterations) due to each user that is taking part in the transaction having a copy of the ledger. The data within the blocks are encrypted by complex algorithms.
The functionality of the blockchain network is focused on two keys, public key (address known in public within the network) and private key (unique address only the user knows).

A private key from a sending user is used to hash encryption algorithms and encrypt and digitally sign the transaction as evidence to the receiving user. The public key of the sending user is then sent on a worldwide scale so that only the receiving user can decrypt it by using the private key of the receiving user.
Solana uses SHA-256 Hashing Algorithm (Same as bitcoin). SHA-256 is a set of proprietary cryptographic functions that output a 256-bit value.
*Hashing is the process of transforming any given key or a string of character into another value.
Transactions are validated by miners by solving complex mathematical problems and adding the block to the blockchain (Proof of work). Adding a block to the blockchain is called mining.




**Arweave Blockchain Attributes**

Blockweave is a specific data storage protocol developed for the Arweave cryptocurrency token (AR -8.52%). Blockweave has a specific consensus mechanism called "proof-of-access" that determines what data can be replicated and by whom. Blockweave miners must be able to recall specific blocks in the Blockweave history to interact with it.
Unlike a traditional blockchain, where each entry in the ledger is linked to the one before it, Blockweave links to both the entry before it and a randomly selected previous block in the system, "weaving" the data together. This is meant to incentivize miners to store more data locally and for much longer, ensuring a long storage life for users as well.
