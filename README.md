# SolanaHackerfestProject

**Solana Health Informatics (SolHI)**
The project is centered around SOLHI, a revolutionary mobile application designed to prevent medical data leakage and ensure the security of patients' data. The app prioritizes user experience with an intuitive and user-friendly design, making it accessible to both tech enthusiasts and beginners. It leverages blockchain technology to decentralize data storage, ensuring security by spreading information across a network and making it harder to breach. The use of blockchain also enhances data integrity and privacy, allowing secure sharing only among authorized parties. SOLHI is compatible with a wide range of devices and platforms, providing a seamless and secure experience for users. Additionally, the app employs state-of-the-art encryption and protection measures to safeguard data, giving users peace of mind. The long-term vision is to become a trusted leader in the healthcare technology industry, setting new standards for safeguarding medical information and ensuring the safety of patients' data.


Background of the Project

Arweave (General Understandings)

- Blockchain based storage platform designed to provide permanent, decentralized
storage for web content and applications.

- Data and Storage Permanence: Capable of storing data (content, files or applications)
in decentralized manner permanently. *Solana can be used to build applications that
interact with storing data with Arweave.

- Cross-Chain Communication: Smart Contracts and Applications with Solana can be
created by developers using Arweave interactions.

- Decentralised Applications (dApps): dApp can be build by leveraging the benefits
from both platforms. Solana as the transaction processor and Arweave as the
immutable data and content storing agent.
